# Rosalind Solutions

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a collection of bioinformatics programming challenges. This
repository contains my solutions created so far, along with sample data.

## Approach

My approach has been understanding the problem, writing code ahead of time, and executing it in irb
with the problem data hardcoded. This could be improved by:

* Making the scripts into standalone executables.
* Passing the rosalind_xxxx.txt file as an argument to a script.
* Formatting the output as expected by the problem specifications.
